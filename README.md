# Matron-Malice

**Matron-Malice** is a fully-fledged, multi-user WebGUI-based security research tool designed for efficient management of callback connection shells. It provides a unified interface for post-exploitation activities, payload generation, session tracking, and collaborative reporting.

> 🚧 This project is currently under development and not yet publicly released.

## Features

- 🔄 **Multi-user Web GUI** – Real-time shell management in a collaborative environment.
- 🧠 **Integrated Servers** – Seamless setup and control of backend listeners and staging environments.
- 🧰 **Post-Exploitation Modules** – Run built-in or custom modules for in-depth system interaction after initial access.
- 🎯 **Payload Generator** – Create and deploy cross-platform payloads for various targets and protocols.
- 📋 **Reporting Engine** – Generate detailed session logs and activity reports for audits or research records.
- ⚙️ **Session & Callback Management** – View, tag, and interact with active or historical connections from a central hub.
- 🔒 **Security-Focused Design** – Built with research and red teaming in mind.

## Use Cases
